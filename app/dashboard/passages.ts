export const mockPassage = `The evolution of cities has always been closely tied to technological advancements. In the 19th century, the steam engine revolutionized transportation, enabling the development of railways and, in turn, the rapid growth of urban centers. Factories, once scattered across rural areas, began clustering in cities, and workers followed suit, resulting in the dense urban landscapes that characterized the Industrial Revolution. This mass migration was driven by the promise of economic opportunities, but it also brought about significant challenges, including overcrowding, poor sanitation, and the spread of disease.

In response to these challenges, urban planners and architects began developing new approaches to city design. In the early 20th century, the Garden City movement, founded by Ebenezer Howard, emerged as a reaction to the negative effects of industrialization. Howard envisioned self-contained communities surrounded by green spaces, with a balance of residential, commercial, and agricultural areas. His ideas sought to blend the best aspects of urban and rural life, promoting healthier living conditions while maintaining access to economic opportunities. Although only a few true garden cities were ever built, the movement influenced the development of suburbs and the layout of modern cities.

By the mid-20th century, the rise of the automobile further transformed urban environments. Cities expanded outward as highways and road networks were constructed, allowing people to live farther from their workplaces. The post-World War II suburban boom in the United States exemplifies this trend, as millions of people moved to newly built suburban neighborhoods, drawn by the promise of more space, privacy, and a perceived higher quality of life. However, this shift had its own drawbacks. Suburban sprawl led to increased reliance on automobiles, contributing to traffic congestion, air pollution, and a loss of open land.

In the 21st century, cities face new challenges and opportunities related to technology. The rise of the internet and digital communication has enabled more people to work remotely, raising questions about the future of urban living. Some experts argue that cities will become less central to economic activity as more people choose to live in smaller towns or rural areas while staying connected through technology. Others believe that cities will continue to thrive, as they offer cultural, social, and economic advantages that cannot be easily replicated in less densely populated areas.

At the same time, new technologies are reshaping urban infrastructure. "Smart cities," which integrate digital technology into transportation, energy, and public services, are becoming increasingly common. Proponents argue that smart cities can improve efficiency, reduce waste, and enhance the quality of life for residents. For example, sensor networks can monitor traffic in real time, helping to reduce congestion and lower emissions. Similarly, smart energy grids can optimize electricity use, reducing energy consumption and costs. However, critics raise concerns about privacy and security, as the widespread collection of data in smart cities could potentially be misused.

Ultimately, the future of cities will likely depend on how well they can adapt to technological changes while addressing the social, environmental, and economic challenges that have always been part of urban life. As cities continue to evolve, finding a balance between innovation and sustainability will be key to ensuring that urban areas remain vibrant, livable, and resilient in the face of ongoing change.

export const artPassage = `The art world has long been influenced by debates surrounding the role of art in society. One of the most enduring debates is whether art should serve a social or political purpose, or whether it should exist solely for the sake of beauty and personal expression. This divide can be traced back to ancient times, when philosophers like Plato argued that art should reflect moral truths and contribute to the betterment of society. For Plato, art was not just a form of entertainment or aesthetic pleasure; it was a tool for teaching and shaping virtuous citizens.

Centuries later, during the Renaissance, a more humanistic approach to art began to emerge. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo emphasized individual creativity and expression, moving away from the rigid moral framework proposed by Plato. Their works often depicted the beauty of the human form and the natural world, focusing less on moral instruction and more on the celebration of human potential. This period marked a shift toward the idea that art could exist for its own sake, separate from any explicit social or political agenda.

However, the debate resurfaced in the 19th and 20th centuries, as art movements like Realism and Modernism began to engage more directly with social and political issues. Realist painters such as Gustave Courbet sought to depict the lives of ordinary people, often highlighting the struggles of the working class. For these artists, art was not just about creating beautiful images but about raising awareness of societal injustices. Similarly, the Modernist movement pushed the boundaries of artistic expression, with many artists using their work to critique established norms and challenge the status quo.

In contrast, other 20th-century movements like Abstract Expressionism focused on the internal, subjective experience of the artist. Artists such as Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko created works that were less concerned with the outside world and more focused on the emotional and psychological states of the individual. For these artists, art was a deeply personal form of expression, disconnected from social or political concerns.

Today, the debate over the purpose of art continues. Some argue that art should address the pressing issues of our time, such as climate change, inequality, and political unrest. Others believe that art should provide an escape from these challenges, offering beauty and emotional solace in a world that often feels chaotic. Ultimately, the role of art in society is likely to remain a topic of debate, as artists and audiences grapple with the question of what art should represent and whom it should serve.`

export const agriculturePassage = `In the early stages of agricultural development, farming communities around the world faced numerous challenges that threatened the sustainability of their settlements. One of the most significant of these challenges was the depletion of soil nutrients, which could lead to a decline in crop yields and eventually force communities to abandon their land in search of more fertile areas. To address this, ancient farmers developed various methods to maintain the fertility of their soil, including crop rotation, the use of animal manure, and the introduction of nitrogen-fixing plants such as legumes. These innovations allowed early agricultural societies to sustain their food production over long periods of time.

However, the rise of industrial agriculture in the 20th century brought about a different set of challenges. While the widespread use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides led to significant increases in crop yields, it also resulted in a range of environmental issues. The excessive use of synthetic fertilizers, for example, has led to the contamination of water supplies with nitrates, contributing to the growth of harmful algal blooms in rivers, lakes, and oceans. Additionally, the reliance on monoculture — the cultivation of a single crop over vast areas — has reduced biodiversity, making crops more vulnerable to pests and diseases. Despite these problems, industrial agriculture has become the dominant model of food production globally, largely due to its efficiency and ability to meet the growing demands of a rapidly expanding population.

In response to the environmental concerns associated with industrial agriculture, a movement known as sustainable agriculture has gained traction in recent decades. Advocates of sustainable agriculture argue that it is possible to produce food in a way that minimizes harm to the environment while still meeting the needs of human populations. Key practices in sustainable agriculture include the use of organic fertilizers, integrated pest management (IPM) to control pests without relying solely on chemical pesticides, and agroforestry, which involves the integration of trees and other perennial plants into agricultural systems to promote biodiversity and improve soil health.

One prominent example of a sustainable agriculture practice is permaculture, a holistic approach to farming that seeks to create self-sustaining agricultural ecosystems by mimicking the diversity and resilience of natural ecosystems. Permaculture emphasizes the importance of working with nature rather than against it, encouraging farmers to consider factors such as water management, soil health, and biodiversity in their decision-making processes. Though permaculture is often practiced on a small scale, its principles have inspired many larger-scale farming operations to adopt more sustainable methods.

Despite the promise of sustainable agriculture, it remains a relatively small part of global food production. Critics argue that sustainable farming practices are less efficient and cannot produce the same high yields as industrial agriculture, making them insufficient to feed the world's growing population. Proponents, however, contend that the long-term benefits of sustainable agriculture, including healthier ecosystems and more resilient food systems, outweigh any short-term reduction in yields. They also argue that many of the environmental and social costs of industrial agriculture, such as pollution and the displacement of small farmers, are not accounted for in conventional economic models.`;

export const cognitiveNeurosciencePassage =  `In the late 20th century, scientific research increasingly began to focus on the field of cognitive neuroscience, a branch of study that investigates the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes such as memory, attention, and decision-making. While this field had its roots in earlier studies of the brain, the development of advanced neuroimaging technologies, like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), greatly expanded researchers’ ability to observe and measure brain activity in real time.

Before these technological advancements, researchers relied heavily on studying individuals with brain damage or abnormalities, which provided important insights but were limited in their scope. For example, studies of patients with damage to specific regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus, helped scientists understand the role of these areas in memory and spatial navigation. However, these studies were often limited by the fact that brain damage rarely occurs in isolated areas, and even when it does, the impact on cognition is not always straightforward.

With the advent of fMRI and PET scans, researchers were able to observe healthy, undamaged brains as individuals engaged in various cognitive tasks. This not only allowed scientists to identify the regions of the brain responsible for specific cognitive functions but also enabled them to explore how different regions interact during complex thought processes. For instance, recent studies using neuroimaging have shown that decision-making involves multiple brain areas, including those associated with emotions, memory, and social reasoning.

These technological advancements have also facilitated research into conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and depression, offering new insights into how these disorders affect brain function. While much progress has been made in understanding the brain, researchers acknowledge that cognitive neuroscience is still in its early stages. There are countless complexities in how the brain operates, and many questions remain about how cognition arises from the interplay of neural circuits.`
